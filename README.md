# Naturalistic-Dynamic-Network-Toolbox(NaDyNet)
Here, we have developed a user-friendly graphical interface toolbox named NaDyNet (Naturalistic Dynamic Network Toolbox), which integrates existing dynamic brain network analysis methods. The core features of NaDyNet include: 1) extracting signals of interest from naturalistic fMRI signals; 2) incorporating six commonly used dynamic analysis methods and three static analysis methods; 3) enhanced versions of these dynamic methods by adopting inter-subject analysis to eliminate the effects of signals of non-interest; 4) performing K-means clustering analysis to identify temporal-reoccurring states along with their temporal and spatial attributes.
